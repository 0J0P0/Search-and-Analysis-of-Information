    "## 1. Preprocessing with ElasticSearch\n",
    "\n",
    "One of the tasks of the previous session was to remove from the documents vocabulary all those strings that were not proper words. Obviously this is a frequent task and all these kinds of DB have standard processes that help to filter and reduce the terms that are not useful for searching.\n",
    "\n",
    "Text, before being indexed, can be subjected to a pipeline of different processes that strips it from anything that will not be useful for a specific application. In ES these preprocessing pipelines are called _Analyzers_; ES includes many choices for each preprocessing step. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "The [following picture](https://www.elastic.co/es/blog/found-text-analysis-part-1) illustrates the chaining of preprocessing steps:\n",
    "\n",
    "![](https://api.contentstack.io/v2/assets/575e4c8c3dc542cb38c08267/download?uid=blt51e787daed39eae9?uid=blt51e787daed39eae9)\n",
    "\n",
    "The first step of the pipeline is usually a process that converts _raw text_ into _tokens_. We can for example tokenize a text using blanks and punctuation signs or use a language specific analyzer that detects words in an specific language or parse HTML/XML...\n",
    "\n",
    "[This section](https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elasticsearch/reference/current/analysis-tokenizers.html) of the ElasticSearch manual explains the different text tokenizers available.\n",
    "\n",
    "Once we have obtained tokens, we can _normalize_ the strings and/or filter out valid tokens that are not useful. For instance, strings can be transformed to lowercase so all occurrences of the same word are mapped to the same token regardless of whether they were capitalized. Also, there are words that are not semantically useful when searching such as adverbs, articles or prepositions, in this case each language will have its own standard list of words; these are usually called \"_stopwords_\". Another language-specific token normalization is stemming. The stem of a word corresponds to the common part of a word from all variants are formed by inflection or addition of suffixes or prefixes. For instance, the words \"unstoppable\", \"stops\" and \"stopping\" all derive from the stem \"stop\". The idea is that all variations of a word will be represented by the same token.\n",
    "\n",
    "[This section](https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elasticsearch/reference/current/analysis-tokenfilters.html) of ElasticSearch manual will give you an idea of the possibilities.\n"

OBGs are objects\\nin which the mass of the central black hole initially exceeds that of the stellar component of the\\nhost galaxy, and the luminosity from black-hole accretion dominates the starlight. From a cosmological\\nsimulation, we demonstrate that there are sites where star formation is initially inhibited and\\ndirect-collapse black holes (DCBHs) form due to the photo-dissociating effect of Lyman-Werner\\nradiation on molecular hydrogen. We show that the formation of OBGs is inevitable, because the probability\\nof finding the required extra-galactic environment and the right physical conditions in a halo\\nconducive to DCBH formation is quite high in the early universe. We estimate an OBG number density\\nof 0.009/Mpc^3 at z~8 and 0.03/Mpc^3 at z~6. Extrapolating from our simulation volume, we infer\\nthat the most luminous quasars detected at z~6 likely transited through an earlier OBG phase. We\\nfind that these primordial galaxies start off with an over-massive BH and acquire their stellar\\ncomponent from subsequent merging as well as in-situ star formation. In doing so, they inevitably\\ngo through an OBG phase dominated by the accretion luminosity at the Eddington rate or below, released\\nfrom the growing BH. The OBG phase is characterised by an ultra-violet (UV) spectrum with slope of\\nbeta ~ -2.3 and the absence of a Balmer Break. OBGs should also be spatially unresolved, and are expected\\nto be brighter than the majority of known high-redshift galaxies. OBGs could potentially be revealed\\nvia HST follow-up imaging of samples of brighter Lyman-break galaxies provided by wide-area ground-based\\nsurveys such as UltraVISTA, and should be easily uncovered and studied with instruments aboard\\nJWST...(abridged) '}\n",

We employ large velocity gradient (LVG) modeling to\\nanalyze the spectra of this source assuming the [C_{II}] and CO emissions originate from (i) separate\\nunvirialized regions, (ii) separate virialized regions, (iii) uniformly mixed unvirialized\\nregion, and (iv) uniformly mixed virialized regions. We present the best fit set of parameters,\\nincluding for each case the ratio $\\\\alpha$ between the total hydrogen/helium gas mass and the CO(1-0)\\nline luminosity. We also present computations of the ratio of H_{2} mass to [C_{II}] line-luminosity\\nfor optically thin conditions, for a range of gas temperatures and densities, for direct conversion\\nof [C_{II}] line-luminosities to \"dark-H_{2}\" masses. For HDF 850.1 we find that a model in which\\nthe CO and C^{+} are uniformly mixed in gas that is shielded from UV radiation, requires a cosmic-ray\\nor X-ray ionization rate of $\\\\zeta \\\\approx$ 10^{-13} s^{-1}, plausibly consistent with the large\\nstar-formation rate ($\\\\sim$ 10^{3} M$_{\\\\odot}$ yr^{-1}) observed in this source. Enforcing the\\ncosmological constraint posed by the abundance of dark matter halos in the standard $\\\\Lambda$CDM\\ncosmology and taking into account other possible contributions to the total gas mass, we find that\\nthree of these four models are less likely at the 2$\\\\sigma$ level. We conclude that modeling HDF 850.1\\'s\\nISM as a collection of unvirialized molecular clouds with distinct CO and C^{+} layers, for which\\n$\\\\alpha$ = 0.6 M$_{\\\\odot}$ (K km s^{-1} pc^{2})^{-1} for the CO to H_{2} mass-to-luminosity ratio,\\n(similar to the standard ULIRG value), is most consistent with the $\\\\Lambda$CDM cosmology.

We use our Spitzer eclipse depths with two previously reported ground-based\\ndata points in the J and K bands to constrain the atmospheric properties of WASP-43b. The data rule\\nout a strong thermal inversion in the dayside atmosphere of WASP-43b.

High-ionization absorption is detected along the three inner\\nsightlines, but not along the three outer sightlines, for which CIV data exist. As inferred from\\n21 cm emission line maps, only one sightline may have a damped Ly-alpha system.

It is the strongest\\nsingle MgII2796 absorption line that we detect, with W_0(2796)=0.63 A. The impact parameters through\\nM31 are similar to the impact parameters of galaxies identified with MgII absorbers at redshifts\\n0.1<z<1.0 in a 2011 study by Rao et al. However, the M31 MgII2796 rest equivalent width values\\nare significantly smaller. In comparison, moderate-to-strong MgII absorption from Milky Way\\ngas is detected along all ten sightlines. Thus, this study indicates that M31 does not present itself\\nas an absorbing galaxy which is typical of higher-redshift galaxies inferred to give rise to moderate-strength\\nquasar absorption lines.

Methods: Using our 3D Monte Carlo Lya\\nradiation transfer code, we study the radiative transfer of Lya, UV and optical continuum photons\\nin homogeneous and clumpy shells of neutral hydrogen and dust surrounding a central source. Our\\nsimulations predict the Lya and continuum escape fraction, the Lya equivalent width EW(Lya), the\\nLya line profile and their dependence on the gas geometry and the main input physical parameters.\\nResults: The ISM clumpiness is found to have a strong impact on the Lya line radiative transfer, entailing\\na strong dependence of the emergent features of the Lya line (escape fraction, EW(Lya)) on the ISM\\nmorphology. Although a clumpy and dusty ISM appears more transparent to radiation (both line and\\ncontinuum) compared to an equivalent homogeneous ISM of equal dust optical depth, we find that the\\nLya photons are, in general, still more attenuated than UV continuum radiation. As a consequence,\\nthe observed Lya equivalent width (EWobs(Lya)) is lower than the intrinsic one (EWint(Lya)) for\\nnearly all clumpy ISM configurations considered. There are, however, special conditions under\\nwhich Lya photons escape more easily than the continuum, resulting in an enhanced EWobs(Lya). The\\nrequirement for this to happen is that the ISM is almost static (galactic outflows < 200 km/s),\\nextremely clumpy (with density contrasts >10^7 in HI between clumps and the interclump medium),\\nand very dusty (E(B-V) > 0.30). When these conditions are fulfilled the emergent Lya line profile\\nshows no velocity shift and little asymmetry. Given the asymmetry and velocity shifts generally\\nobserved in starburst galaxies with Lya emission, we conclude that clumping is unlikely to significantly\\nenhance their relative Lya/UV transmission.
