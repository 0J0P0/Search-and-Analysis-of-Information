Pagerank\n","\n","In class we have explained the iterative method for computing PageRank using matricial notation (i.e. the ``power method''). \n","The iterative step was the matrix-times-vector product $P(t) = M^T*P(t-1)$,\n","but then we replaced $M$ with the Google matrix $G = d*M + (1-d)/n * J$, where $d$ is the \\emph{damping factor}. \n","This was done in order to guarantee a unique solution and its fast convergence to it.\n","\n","In this lab, we assume that a graph $G=(V,E)$ is given to us as a table of vertices + for each one, a list\n","of successors. This is known as the _adjacency list_ representation. In cases where we have significantly fewer edges than the maximum possible (e.g. in a graph with $n$ nodes we may have $O(n)$ edges instead of the maximum $O(n^2)$ possible. In this case, the adjacency list representation is much more compact than the matrix. Additionally for very large graphs we may not even be able to fit the full matrix into main memory, and would need instead to process few adjacency lists at a time.\n","\n","An efficient implementation of the formula using an adjacency list representation of $G$\n","instead of a matrix $M$ would be:\n","\n","```\n"," 1. n = number of vertices in G\n"," 2.
