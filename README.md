## Guide to Running and Executing the Container

This guide outlines the steps to run the container, access its shell, verify the Python installation, copy a folder from your local machine to the container, and stop the container when done.

---

### 1. Run the container

Use the following command to start the Docker container in the background:

```bash
docker-compose up -d
```

- The `-d` flag runs the container in "detached" mode, allowing it to run in the background.
- Ensure your terminal is in the same directory as the `docker-compose.yml` file.
  - If not, navigate to the directory containing the `docker-compose.yml` file before running the command. The `docker-compose.yml` and `Dockerfile` files should be in the same directory.
---

### 2. Open a shell in the container

Once the container is running, you can open an interactive shell inside the container by running:

```bash
docker exec -it elasticsearch /bin/bash
```

- **`-it`**: These flags enable interactive terminal mode.
- **`elasticsearch`**: This is the name of the running container.

---

#### 2.1 Verify Python version

After accessing the container shell, verify that Python 3.11 is installed by running:

```bash
python3 --version
```

This should display something like:

```
Python 3.11.x
```

#### 2.2 Copy the `CAI` folder to the container

To copy a folder from your local machine into the running container, use the following command in a separate terminal (not inside the container shell):

```bash
docker cp ./CAI elasticsearch:./
```

- **`./CAI`**: This is the path to the folder on your local machine that you want to copy.
- **`elasticsearch:./`**: This tells Docker to copy the folder into the root directory of the `elasticsearch` container.

Once copied, you can verify the folder was successfully transferred by checking the containerâ€™s file system from the shell:

```bash
cd /
ls -a
```

You should see the `CAI` folder listed in the directory.

---

### 3. Exit the container shell

When you are done interacting with the container shell, you can exit by typing:

```bash
exit
```

This will close the shell but leave the container running in the background.

---

### 4. Stop the container

When you are finished with the container, you can stop it by running the following command:

```bash
docker-compose stop
```

This will stop the container but keep it available for future use.
